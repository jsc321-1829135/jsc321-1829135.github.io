        <h1>Some Css</h1>
        <h2>Paragraph 1</h2>
        <p style="font-style:bold;">
            This is the first paragraph. I do not know what to write here but I will now write a small short story.
                There once was a boy.
                His name was Joe.
                He had no friends.
                He wanted friends.
                He never got any.
                    -The end
        </p>

        <h2>Paragraph 2 with different font</h2>
        <p style="font-style:italic;">
            This is the second paragraph. Here is a variation on the story from the first paragraph.
            There once was a boy.
                His name was Bo.
                He had no friends.
                He wanted friends.
                He made friends with Joe.
                Now Bo and Joe both have a friend
                    -The end
        </p>
